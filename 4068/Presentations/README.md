# Presentations

This folder contains all teaching presentations for the unit, provided in OpenDocument Presentation format (`.odp`). Each presentation is accompanied by an accessible `.rtf` summary for quick reference or alternative viewing.

## Contents

- **01 Introduction to Safe Robot Environments.odp / .rtf**  
  Overview of industrial robot safety, workplace hazards, and best practices.
- **02 Risks and Hazards.odp / .rtf**  
  Identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks in mechatronic systems.
- **03 Programming Foundations.odp / .rtf**  
  Basics of robot programming, interfacing, and control logic.
- **04 PLC Programming Exercise.odp / .rtf**  
  Introduction to PLC ladder logic and practical programming exercises.

## How to Use

- Open `.odp` files with [LibreOffice Impress](https://www.libreoffice.org/), [OpenOffice Impress](https://www.openoffice.org/), or any compatible office suite.
- Use `.rtf` files for quick review, accessibility, or if you do not have access to an OpenDocument-compatible program.

## Important Note

A significant portion of this unit involves hands-on programming and debugging of hardware using MATLAB and Simulink.  
**Please plan to allocate substantial time for:**
- Setting up and troubleshooting hardware connections (e.g., ESP32, sensors, actuators)
- Debugging code and resolving integration issues in MATLAB/Simulink
- Iterative testing and validation of your robotic system

Experience shows that hardware integration and debugging often take longer than expectedâ€”be sure to start early and allow extra time in your project schedule.
