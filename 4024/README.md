## Open Document Formats Policy

All teaching materials (such as presentations and documents) are shared in **Open Document formats** (e.g., `.odt`, `.odp`, `.ods`).  
**Do not save or push files in Microsoft proprietary formats** (such as `.docx` or `.pptx`) to this repository—this is highly discouraged.

- Microsoft Office programs (Word, PowerPoint, etc.) will show a warning and recommend converting Open Document files to their closed formats.  
  **Always ignore this warning and continue working in the Open Document format.**
- Microsoft Office does not allow saving Open Document files directly to OneDrive.  
  Save your work locally and upload to the repository as needed.
- To disable the conversion warning in Microsoft Office:  
  Go to `File` → `Options` → `Save` → Uncheck "Prompt to convert on open" or similar option.

**Summary:**  
- Only use and share `.odt`, `.ods`, `.odp`, etc.  
- Ignore Microsoft Office prompts to convert files.  
- Do not upload `.docx` or `.pptx` files to the repository.
